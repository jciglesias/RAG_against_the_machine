      "answer": "Tensor parallelism in vLLM shards model parameters across multiple GPUs within each model layer. It should be used when the model is too large to fit on a single GPU or when you need to reduce memory pressure per GPU to allow more KV cache space for higher throughput. This is the most common strategy for large model inference within a single node.",

      "answer": "vLLM shards and quantizes weights during initialization to avoid memory overhead.
